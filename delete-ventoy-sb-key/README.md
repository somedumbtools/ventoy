# delete ventoy secure boot key
this part of the repo contains some source code that is on the ISO made by the publisher

you can see the files by extracting it with a tool such as 7-Zip, WinRAR, and so on... (go to initd.cpio if you're on the archive to see the scripts that I put here)

TODO:
- vmlinuz, bc i'm so lazy rn

# sources
s/o (shoutout to) [@SpecLad](https://github.com/ventoy/DeleteVentoySecureBootKey/issues/2) that put this idea in my head
